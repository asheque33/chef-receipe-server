Now as head chef of London's gloriously French all-day brasserie Maison Francois, he's found his happy place cooking simple yet flavour-packed classical food.'When I started cooking, I thought that Michelin stars and fine dining was the peak of food,' Matt explains. 'But over time as I ate in more of those types of restaurants, I started to realise that I didn't enjoy those sorts of places as much as I first thought. It would be lovely mouthfuls but I wanted platefuls! At the same time, I was eating at restaurants doing food that was simpler but just as delicious, and started to think that maybe there's a nice blend.'"
